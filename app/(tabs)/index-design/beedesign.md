To make this even better, you could:
Replace the FontAwesome icons with custom images for more realistic flowers and a proper bumblebee 2. Add wing-flapping animation by alternating between two bee images
Make the flowers slightly sway using additional animations
Add a subtle trail behind the bee
Make the animation respond to user interactions (like speeding up when a deed is completed)
Would you like me to expand on any of these enhancements?
